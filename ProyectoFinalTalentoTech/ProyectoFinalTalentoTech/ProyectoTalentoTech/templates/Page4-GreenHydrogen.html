                            <p>Green hydrogen is a type of hydrogen fuel that is produced through the electrolysis of water using electricity derived exclusively from renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, or hydropower. During the electrolysis process, water (H₂O) is split into hydrogen (H₂) and oxygen (O₂), and because no fossil fuels are used and no greenhouse gases are emitted, the hydrogen produced is considered completely clean and environmentally friendly.</p>

                            <p>This form of hydrogen is gaining increasing attention as a key component in the transition to a low-carbon economy. It can be used in various sectors, including transportation (especially in fuel-cell vehicles), heavy industry (such as steel and cement production), power generation, and as an energy storage solution. Although green hydrogen is currently more expensive to produce than hydrogen derived from fossil fuels (grey or blue hydrogen), ongoing advancements in technology and falling renewable energy costs are making it increasingly viable as a large-scale, sustainable energy solution.</p>

                <p>The largest operational green hydrogen project in the world as of now is Sinopec’s Kuqa plant, located in Xinjiang, China. It features a 260 megawatt (MW) electrolysis capacity and began producing green hydrogen in June 2023. The project uses solar energy to power the electrolysis process, which separates hydrogen from water.</p>

                <p>Green hydrogen generates only water vapor as a byproduct when used, making it a clean energy source. During production via electrolysis powered by renewable energy, the only byproduct is oxygen, which is harmless to the environment. </p>

                <p>Despite recent progress, green hydrogen still accounts for only a small portion of Colombia’s total production. In 2024, 76% of the hydrogen consumed was grey (from fossil fuels), 20% was blue (with carbon capture), and only 4% came from electrolysis, the method linked to green hydrogen. As a major initiative, Ecopetrol has announced the construction of the largest green hydrogen plant in Latin America at its Cartagena refinery. With an investment of approximately $28.5 million, the facility is expected to produce 800 tons of green hydrogen annually and begin operations in the first half of 2026.</p>
