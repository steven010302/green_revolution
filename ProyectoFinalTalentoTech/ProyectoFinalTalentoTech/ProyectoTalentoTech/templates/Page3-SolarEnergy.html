                          <p>Solar energy is a form of renewable energy that originates from the radiation emitted by the sun. This energy can be harnessed and converted into usable forms such as electricity or thermal energy through various technologies. It is considered one of the cleanest, most abundant, and sustainable sources of energy available to humanity.</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Sunlight Hits Solar Panels:</strong> Solar panels are made up of photovoltaic (PV) cells, usually made from silicon. When sunlight hits these cells, it excites the electrons inside them.</li>
                                <li><strong>Electric Current Is Generated:</strong> This movement of electrons creates a direct current (DC) of electricity. This is the basic principle of the photovoltaic effect.</li>
                                <li><strong>Inverter Converts DC to AC:</strong> Most homes and businesses use alternating current (AC) electricity. So the DC electricity flows into an inverter, which converts it into usable AC power.</li>
                                <li><strong>Electricity Powers Your Devices:</strong> The converted AC electricity is sent to your electrical panel, where it powers your lights, appliances, and other devices.</li>
                                <li><strong>Excess Energy Can Be Stored or Shared:</strong> If you produce more electricity than you use, it can be stored in batteries for later. Or, it can be sent to the electric grid, and in many places, you get credits or payments (this is called net metering).</li>
                            </ol>

                <h2>Advantages</h2>                    
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Renewable Energy Source:</strong> Solar energy is available every day and will never run out as long as the sun exists.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reduces Electricity Bills:</strong> By generating your own power, you can significantly lower your electricity costs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Low Maintenance Costs:</strong> Solar systems generally require minimal maintenance â€” just occasional cleaning and periodic checks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Environmentally Friendly:</strong> Solar power generation does not release greenhouse gases, making it a clean and green energy source.</li>
                    <li><strong>Energy Independence:</strong> Producing your own electricity reduces reliance on external energy suppliers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Versatile Applications:</strong> Solar energy can be used for electricity, heating, powering remote areas, desalinating water, and even fueling satellites.</li>
                    <li><strong>Increases Property Value:</strong> Homes with solar panels can have higher market value and attract more buyers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Job Creation:</strong> The solar industry creates thousands of jobs in manufacturing, installation, and maintenance.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The La Loma Solar Park, located in the municipality of El Paso in the Cesar department, is currently the largest solar power plant in Colombia. Developed by Enel Green Power Colombia, it was officially inaugurated in February 2024. The facility boasts an installed capacity of 187 megawatts (MW) and comprises over 400,000 bifacial solar panels spread across approximately 437 hectares. These panels are mounted on automated tracking systems that follow the sun's movement to maximize energy capture throughout the day.</p>
